                Southwest University of Science and Technology is located in
                Mianyang City, Sichuan Province, a science and technology city
                in China. The school is a university jointly built by the
                People's Government of Sichuan Province and the Ministry of
                Education. It is a university jointly built by the People's
                Government of Sichuan Province and the State Administration of
                Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. It has
                been identified by the Ministry of Education as one of the 14
                universities in the western region that are under national key
                construction. Comrade Li Lanqing, former member of the Standing
                Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
                and Vice Premier of the State Council, praised the school's
                "co-construction and regional industry-university-research joint
                education" for having developed a school-running path with its
                own characteristics. The current party secretary of the school
                is Dong Faqin and the principal Huang Qi.

                The school currently has more than 39,000 students. It has 16
                colleges including the National Defense Science and Technology
                Institute, with 85 undergraduate majors in 9 major disciplines
                including engineering, agriculture, science, economics, law,
                literature, management, education, and art; it has first-level
                doctorate degrees There are 5 authorization points, 18 doctoral
                degree authorization points in second-level disciplines; 24
                master's degree authorization points in first-level disciplines,
                88 master's degree authorization points in second-level
                disciplines; and 15 professional master's degree categories.
                There are 3 postdoctoral research stations, and doctoral
                students are jointly trained in 4 disciplines with the China
                Academy of Engineering Physics. There are 2 "double first-class"
                construction disciplines (groups) in Sichuan Province, 4
                provincial-level advantageous disciplines, 11 provincial-level
                key disciplines, 1 basic national defense discipline approved by
                the Bureau of National Defense Science and Industry, and 5
                national defense specialty disciplines. Four disciplines,
                materials science, engineering science, chemistry, and
                environment/ecology, have entered the top 1% of ESI rankings,
                among which three disciplines of materials science, engineering
                science, and chemistry have entered the top 5â€° of ESI rankings.

                Functional materials are generally characterised as those
                materials which possess particular native properties and
                functions of their own. For example, ferroelectricity,
                piezoelectricity, magnetism or energy storage functions.
              </p>
              <p className=" text-justify">
                Functional materials are found in all classes of materials:
                ceramics, metals, polymers and organic molecules. Functional
                materials are often used in electromagnetic applications from
                KHz to THz and at optical frequencies where the plasmonic
                properties of metals assume particular importance. Functional
                materials are also of critical importance in materials for
                energy such as electro- and magnetocaloric materials, for energy
                storage and for solar harvesting functions.
